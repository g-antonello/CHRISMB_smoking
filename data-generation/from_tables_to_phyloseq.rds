#OTU table
otu_tab <- read.csv("00_Taxa_counts_samples_GA.csv", row.names = 1)
#otu_tab <- data.matrix(otu_tab)


#TAXONOMY table
taxa_tab <- read.csv("00_taxa_assign_GA.csv", row.names = 1)
taxa_tab <- as.matrix(taxa_tab)


#METADATA table | generated using the script in original files/mapping files with its scripts inside
mapping_tab <- read.csv("mapping file generation/00_CHRISMB_NAFLD mapping file.csv", row.names = 1)
rownames(mapping_tab) <- mapping_tab$michigan_codes
mapping_tab <- mapping_tab[match(rownames(otu_tab), mapping_tab$michigan_codes),]

#remove samples not in the mapping table
otu_tab <- otu_tab[rownames(otu_tab) %in% mapping_tab$michigan_codes,]
#prune taxa
otu_tab <- otu_tab[rowSums(otu_tab) > 0,]

#retain taxa table only with ASV that actually show up in the dataset
taxa_tab <- taxa_tab[rownames(taxa_tab)%in% colnames(otu_tab),]

#Merge previous files together
otu_tab_ph <- otu_table(otu_tab, taxa_are_rows = FALSE)

ps1 <- merge_phyloseq(otu_tab_ph, taxa_tab_ph, mapping_tab_ph)

```
the first time I did it, 09_03_2020, here is what happened:
one sample was absent in the metadata file but was present in the otu_table file: NUIA68376. When inverting the two arguments of the code, I found what was not matching in the otu table, and it was NUIA168376.
I concluded that there was a typo somewhere along the process, but all sample names remained unique, so I decided to simply correct the typo and write a corrected version of ASV table.

# QC steps
```{r}

head(sort(sample_sums(ps1)))

ps1_pruned <- subset_samples(ps1, sample_sums(ps1) >= 1000) %>% 
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.)>0,.)

```

#make a fasta file to build a tree
```{r}

phyloseq_to_fasta(physeq = ps1_pruned, seq_location = "tax_table", destination_file = "reference_seqs/r_generated_CHRISMB_NAFLD_phyloseq.fasta")
# these two commands need to be run on the cluster, where the two programs have been installed.

#1# username$ mafft --maxiterate 200 r_generated_CHRISMB_phyloseq.fasta > aligned_seqs
#2# username$ FastTree aligned_seqs -> first_tree_attempt.tre


```
# Add phylogenetic tree
This tree is generated from MAFFT and FastTree at standard settings, done on the cluster, starting from the fasta file generated in the chunk above.
```{r}
tree_file <- ape::read.tree("reference_seqs/first_tree_attempt.tre")

ps1_pruned <- merge_phyloseq(ps1_pruned, tree_file)
```

```{r}
#use this only in case you use option 2 for metadata
## example only chrismb, otherwise use only last line
study_of_interest <- c("chrismb", "nafld")

ps1_pruned <- subset_samples(ps1_pruned, CHRIS_project == study_of_interest)
ps1_pruned <- subset_taxa(ps1_pruned_chrismb, taxa_sums(ps1_pruned_chrismb) >0)
saveRDS(object = ps1_pruned, file = paste("01", paste(study_of_interest, collapse = "_"), "phyloseq.rds", sep = "_"))


```
